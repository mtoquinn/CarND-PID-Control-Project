PID-Control-Project Writeup

I started by implementing the PID Controller code from the lesson and started with the PID values that were used with that code. Those values successfully drove the car around the track but left quite a bit to be desired, so I manually tuned them. I started by tuning the value for P. I noticed that if this value was too small the vehicles would not properly navigate the corners and would not stay on the track at all. If the P value was too high the car would take very sharp turns and eventually left the track as a result turning to much for a small corner. The value for I needed to be small for the car to stay in the center of the track well and prevent sick passengers. A high value for I resulted in the car driving in circles. The value for D was useful in keeping the car fairly centered and also was crucial to steering correctly in the turns, particularly the sharp ones. A value that was too high meant the car was struggling to turn and a value that was too low meant the car was turning too much. I stayed fairly close to the paramters from the lesson but did ultimately change all of them.
